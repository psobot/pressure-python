# `pressure`
*A reimplementation of Python's synchronized and bounded Queue.Queue on a Redis backend.*

---

`pressure` implements everybody's favourite Python data structure, the
trusty built-in `Queue.Queue`, on top of everybody's favourite distributed
data store, Redis. Nearly all of the original Queue's API is replicated.

`pressure` allows for **synchronized**, **blocking** and **distributed**
(a.k.a.: multi-process) queues to be shared between processes, between 
machines, and even between data centers.

See [`protocol.md`](https://github.com/psobot/pressure/blob/master/protocol.md) 
in the master repo ([`pressure`](https://github.com/psobot/pressure))
for a thorough (RFC-style) description of the protocol used.

## Examples

    import pressure

    #   Create two unique handles to the 'test' queue.
    q1 = pressure.PressureQueue('test')
    q2 = pressure.PressureQueue('test')

    #   Create the 'test' queue, giving a bound of 5.
    q1.create(bound=5)
    
    #   Put the strings into one handle.
    for string in ["hello", "goodbye"]:
        q1.put(string)

    #   Close the queue - assert that no more data will be produced.
    q1.close()

    #   Receive the strings from the other handle!
    for result in q2:
        print result

    # Prints:
    #   "hello"
    #   "goodbye"

    #   Delete the queue from the database once its data has been consumed.
    #   This should be done on the consumer's end, as the consumer knows
    #   once all of the data is gone.
    q2.delete()

## Get Started

    > sudo pip install pressure

    # for quick local testing, make sure you have redis-server running
    > redis-server &

    # muck around with ipython?
    > cd python
    > ipython

## TODOs

    - Ensure that this library has 100% API coverage with the original Queue.Queue.
    - Clean up and document the internals.
